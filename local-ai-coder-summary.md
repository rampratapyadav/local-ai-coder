local AI coder. To recap, we now have:


   1. A Local AI Backend: Powered by Ollama running the codellama model.
   2. A Web-Based Chat Interface: Accessible via http://localhost:8000, offering a continuous
      chat experience with streaming, Markdown-rendered responses.
   3. A Powerful CLI Agent: The local-ai-coder command-line tool that:
       * Accepts direct prompts.
       * Provides an interactive session for multi-turn conversations.
       * Acts as an agent: It can interpret tool calls from the AI (like reading/writing
         files, listing directories, and running shell commands), execute them locally, and
         feed the results back to the AI for further reasoning.


  This is a solid foundation for your "self-learning blackbox AI agent."

  What would you like to focus on next? Here are some possibilities:


   * Enhance Tool Use: Make the tool parsing more robust, add more specific tools (e.g.,
     searching file content, creating directories, replacing text in files).
   * "Self-Learning" Implementation: Discuss how to collect interaction data from your
     sessions to fine-tune the codellama model for your specific needs and coding style.
     (This is an advanced topic requiring more resources).
   * Project Context Awareness: How can the AI automatically understand your project's
     structure, dependencies, and existing code to provide more relevant assistance?
   * Error Handling & Robustness: Improve the stability and error reporting of both the CLI
     and web GUI.
   * Packaging & Distribution: Explore options for making your local-ai-coder CLI easier to
     install and distribute.

### Implemented Features:

1.  **Core AI Backend:**
    *   Integration with **Ollama** to run local LLMs (specifically `codellama`).
    *   No internet connectivity required after initial model download.

2.  **Web-Based Chat Interface (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`):**
    *   Basic chat UI.
    *   Communication with local Ollama API (`http://localhost:11434/api/chat`).
    *   Conversation history persistence *within the session*.
    *   Streaming responses from AI.
    *   Markdown rendering of AI responses.
    *   Served via a local HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server`) to resolve CORS issues.

3.  **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Agent (`cli.js`, `package.json`):**
    *   Executable command (`local-ai-coder`) via `npm link`.
    *   Direct prompting (`local-ai-coder "your prompt"`).
    *   **Interactive Session:** Continuous conversation until `exit`/`quit`.
    *   **Conversation History Persistence:** Saves and loads history across sessions (`conversation_history.json`).
    *   **Agentic Tool Use:**
        *   AI can call specific tools defined in `cli.js`.
        *   Tools implemented (with user confirmation for destructive actions like `write_file`, `run_shell_command`, `replace_in_file`):
            *   `read_file(filePath)`
            *   `write_file(filePath, content)`
            *   `list_directory(dirPath)`
            *   `run_shell_command(command)`
            *   `search_file_content(filePath, pattern)`
            *   `create_directory(dirPath)`
            *   `replace_in_file(filePath, oldString, newString)`
        *   Tool output is fed back to the AI.
    *   **Data Collection for Fine-tuning:** Logs all interactions (user prompt, AI response, tool calls/outputs) to `agent_interactions.jsonl`.
    *   **Advanced Agentic Features (Partial Implementation):**
        *   **Structured Planning:** Parses and executes AI-generated JSON plans within `<plan>` blocks.
        *   **Plan Execution Engine:** Iterates through plan steps, executes tools, supports `output_variable` for context, and `iterate_on` for processing lists.
        *   **Argument Resolution:** Resolves placeholders like `${item}` and `${variable_name}` in tool arguments.

### Pending/Future Scope:

1.  **"Self-Learning" (Fine-tuning):**
    *   **Data Formatting Script:** **Implemented** (`data_formatter.py` transforms `agent_interactions.jsonl` into `formatted_data.jsonl` for fine-tuning).
    *   **Fine-tuning Process:** **Outlined** (`fine_tune_model.py` provides a conceptual script for fine-tuning using Hugging Face `transformers` and `PEFT`. Actual execution requires manual setup and significant computational resources).
    *   **Deployment of Fine-tuned Model:** **Outlined** (Steps to integrate a fine-tuned model with Ollama, including merging adapters, converting to GGUF, creating a Modelfile, and importing the model).

    ### Testing the Data Formatting Script
    To test the `data_formatter.py` module:
    1.  **Generate Interaction Data:** Use the CLI agent (`local-ai-coder`) to interact with the AI and generate some `agent_interactions.jsonl` content.
    2.  **Run the Formatting Script:** Execute `python3 data_formatter.py` from your project root.
    3.  **Verify Output:** Inspect the `formatted_data.jsonl` file to ensure the data is correctly structured for fine-tuning. Each line should be a JSON object with a `messages` array, containing `user` and `assistant` roles, with tool calls and outputs embedded in the assistant's content.

2.  **Enhance Tool Use (Further Robustness & Features):**
    *   **More Robust Tool Parsing:** Current parsing is regex-based; could be improved for complex arguments or multiple tool calls in a single AI response more reliably.
    *   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Enhance error handling in `processMessage` for AI interaction and tool execution failures.
    *   **Argument Validation:** More comprehensive type/format validation for tool arguments.

3.  **Advanced Agentic Features (Further Development):**
    *   **Self-Correction:** Implement logic for the AI to identify and correct its own mistakes or failed tool executions during plan execution.
    *   **More Sophisticated Context Management:** Develop broader, persistent, or dynamically updated project context for the AI to reason about.
    *   **Deeper Planning & Reasoning Integration:** Allow the AI more control over execution flow, including dynamic plan modification.

4.  **Project Context Awareness:**
    *   Implement mechanisms for the AI to automatically understand the project's structure, dependencies (e.g., by reading `package.json`, `requirements.txt`), and existing code without explicit prompts.

5.  **User Experience (UI/UX) Improvements:**
    *   **Web GUI:**
        *   Implement cross-session conversation history persistence.
        *   Implement code highlighting within rendered Markdown.
        *   Consider how to display tool outputs more effectively if the web UI were to interact with the agent directly.
        *   Add more interactive elements.
    *   **CLI:** Improved formatting of tool outputs, progress indicators for long-running commands.

6.  **Packaging & Distribution:**
    *   Set up a proper `npm publish` process for the CLI.
    *   Consider creating a standalone executable.
