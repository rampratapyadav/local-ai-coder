local AI coder. To recap, we now have:


   1. A Local AI Backend: Powered by Ollama running the codellama model.
   2. A Web-Based Chat Interface: Accessible via http://localhost:8000, offering a continuous
      chat experience with streaming, Markdown-rendered responses.
   3. A Powerful CLI Agent: The local-ai-coder command-line tool that:
       * Accepts direct prompts.
       * Provides an interactive session for multi-turn conversations.
       * Acts as an agent: It can interpret tool calls from the AI (like reading/writing
         files, listing directories, and running shell commands), execute them locally, and
         feed the results back to the AI for further reasoning.


  This is a solid foundation for your "self-learning blackbox AI agent."

  Our current focus is on **Fine-Tuning** the model to make the agent truly functional.

### Implemented Features:

1.  **Core AI Backend:**
    *   Integration with **Ollama** to run local LLMs (specifically `codellama`).
    *   No internet connectivity required after initial model download.

2.  **Web-Based Chat Interface (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`):**
    *   Basic chat UI.
    *   Communication with local Ollama API (`http://localhost:11434/api/chat`).
    *   Conversation history persistence *within the session*.
    *   Streaming responses from AI.
    *   Markdown rendering of AI responses.
    *   Served via a local HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server`) to resolve CORS issues.

3.  **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Agent (`cli.js`, `package.json`):**
    *   Executable command (`local-ai-coder`) via `npm link`.
    *   Direct prompting (`local-ai-coder "your prompt"`).
    *   **Interactive Session:** Continuous conversation until `exit`/`quit`.
    *   **Conversation History Persistence:** Saves and loads history across sessions (`conversation_history.json`).
    *   **Agentic Tool Use:**
        *   AI can call specific tools defined in `cli.js`.
        *   Tools implemented: `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`, `run_shell_command`, `search_file_content`, `create_directory`, `replace_in_file`.
        *   Tool output is fed back to the AI.
    *   **Data Collection for Fine-tuning:** Logs all interactions to `agent_interactions.jsonl`.
    *   **Advanced Agentic Features:**
        *   **Structured Planning:** Parses and executes AI-generated JSON plans.
        *   **Plan Execution Engine:** Iterates through plan steps, executes tools, and manages context.
        *   **Advanced Argument Resolution:** Resolves variables in tool arguments.
        *   **Robust Tool Parsing & Argument Validation.**
        *   **Goal-Oriented Reasoning:** The agent uses a high-level goal to guide its planning and error recovery.

4.  **Fine-Tuning Pipeline (Ready for Implementation):**
    *   **Data Formatting:** `data_formatter.py` script.
    *   **Fine-Tuning Script:** `fine_tune_model.py` script.
    *   **Merge and Export Script:** `merge_and_export.py` script.
    *   **Deployment Instructions.**

5.  **Advanced Self-Correction:**
    *   The agent has recovery strategies for tool failures.

### Next Step: Fine-Tuning (Top Priority)

*   **Fine-Tuning Implementation:** Execute the actual fine-tuning of the `codellama` model.

### Future Scope (Lower Priority)

*   **Core Agent Capabilities:** Continue to enhance the agent's reasoning.
*   **Tooling and Robustness:** Re-evaluate Git tools and improve error handling.
*   **User Experience:** Further enhance the Web GUI and CLI.
*   **Packaging and Distribution:** Consider a standalone executable.
