local AI coder. To recap, we now have:


   1. A Local AI Backend: Powered by Ollama running the codellama model.
   2. A Web-Based Chat Interface: Accessible via http://localhost:8000, offering a continuous
      chat experience with streaming, Markdown-rendered responses.
   3. A Powerful CLI Agent: The local-ai-coder command-line tool that:
       * Accepts direct prompts.
       * Provides an interactive session for multi-turn conversations.
       * Acts as an agent: It can interpret tool calls from the AI (like reading/writing
         files, listing directories, and running shell commands), execute them locally, and
         feed the results back to the AI for further reasoning.


  This is a solid foundation for your "self-learning blackbox AI agent."

  What would you like to focus on next? Here are some possibilities:


   * Enhance Tool Use: Make the tool parsing more robust, add more specific tools (e.g.,
     searching file content, creating directories, replacing text in files).
   * "Self-Learning" Implementation: Discuss how to collect interaction data from your
     sessions to fine-tune the codellama model for your specific needs and coding style.
     (This is an advanced topic requiring more resources).
   * Project Context Awareness: How can the AI automatically understand your project's
     structure, dependencies, and existing code to provide more relevant assistance?
   * Error Handling & Robustness: Improve the stability and error reporting of both the CLI
     and web GUI.
   * Packaging & Distribution: Explore options for making your local-ai-coder CLI easier to
     install and distribute.

### Implemented Features:

1.  **Core AI Backend:**
    *   Integration with **Ollama** to run local LLMs (specifically `codellama`).
    *   No internet connectivity required after initial model download.

2.  **Web-Based Chat Interface (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`):**
    *   Basic chat UI.
    *   Communication with local Ollama API (`http://localhost:11434/api/chat`).
    *   Conversation history persistence *within the session*.
    *   Streaming responses from AI.
    *   Markdown rendering of AI responses.
    *   Served via a local HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server`) to resolve CORS issues.

3.  **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Agent (`cli.js`, `package.json`):**
    *   Executable command (`local-ai-coder`) via `npm link`.
    *   Direct prompting (`local-ai-coder "your prompt"`).
    *   **Interactive Session:** Continuous conversation until `exit`/`quit`.
    *   **Conversation History Persistence:** Saves and loads history across sessions (`conversation_history.json`).
    *   **Agentic Tool Use:**
        *   AI can call specific tools defined in `cli.js`.
        *   Tools implemented (with user confirmation for destructive actions like `write_file`, `run_shell_command`, `replace_in_file`):
            *   `read_file(filePath)`
            *   `write_file(filePath, content)`
            *   `list_directory(dirPath)`
            *   `run_shell_command(command)`
            *   `search_file_content(filePath, pattern)`
            *   `create_directory(dirPath)`
            *   `replace_in_file(filePath, oldString, newString)`
        *   Tool output is fed back to the AI.
    *   **Data Collection for Fine-tuning:** Logs all interactions (user prompt, AI response, tool calls/outputs) to `agent_interactions.jsonl`.
    *   **Advanced Agentic Features (Partial Implementation):**
        *   **Structured Planning:** Parses and executes AI-generated JSON plans within `<plan>` blocks.
        *   **Plan Execution Engine:** Iterates through plan steps, executes tools, supports `output_variable` for context, and `iterate_on` for processing lists.
        *   **Advanced Argument Resolution:** Resolves placeholders like `${item}` and `${variable_name}` in tool arguments. The new parser can handle nested objects and arrays, and resolve variables from the context.

4.  **Fine-Tuning Pipeline:**
    *   **Data Formatting:** `data_formatter.py` script to transform `agent_interactions.jsonl` into a format suitable for fine-tuning.
    *   **Fine-Tuning Script:** `fine_tune_model.py` script to fine-tune the `codellama` model using LoRA.
    *   **Merge and Export Script:** `merge_and_export.py` script to merge the trained LoRA adapters with the base model.
    *   **Deployment Instructions:** The process for converting the model to GGUF and running it in Ollama is documented.

### Pending/Future Scope:

### Core Agent Capabilities


*   **Advanced Self-Correction:** The current implementation can create a new plan on failure. However, more advanced self-correction, such as intelligently retrying a failed step with modified arguments or adjusting the strategy without a full re-plan, is not yet implemented.
*   **Deeper Reasoning:** The agent lacks a deeper understanding of its goals. Features like goal-oriented reasoning, learning from past plan failures, and resource awareness are still pending.
*   **Proactive Context Management:** The agent currently relies on tools like `get_project_context` to be explicitly called. A more advanced, proactive system where the agent automatically understands the project context is a future goal.

### Tooling and Robustness

*   **Robust Tool Parsing:** The `parseToolCall` function in `cli.js` is still regex-based and could be improved to more reliably handle complex arguments or multiple tool calls.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The main `processMessage` loop could have more robust error handling for AI interaction and tool execution failures.
*   **Argument Validation:** The tools themselves could have more comprehensive validation for the types and formats of the arguments they receive.

### User Experience

*   **Web GUI Enhancements:** The web interface is still missing several key features, including cross-session conversation history, code highlighting for rendered markdown, and a more effective way to display tool outputs.
*   **CLI Enhancements:** The command-line interface could be improved with better formatting for tool outputs and progress indicators for long-running commands.

### Packaging and Distribution

*   The project is not yet set up for easy distribution. This includes creating a proper npm package for the CLI and considering a standalone executable.
