    "content": "\nThe `cli.js` file is a small JavaScript file that sets up a command-line interface (CLI) for the Local AI Coder. It defines two functions: `start` and `stop`. The `start` function is called when the user runs the `local-ai-coder` command in their terminal, and it sets up the CLI by listening for input from the user. The `stop` function is called when the user presses `Ctrl + C` to stop the CLI, and it cleans up any resources used by the CLI.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of what happens in the `cli.js` file:\n\n1. The `start` function is defined at the top of the file. It takes no arguments and returns nothing.\n2. Inside the `start` function, we first import some Node.js modules that we need to set up the CLI. These include `readline`, which allows us to read input from the user, and `process`, which provides information about the process running the code.\n3. We then define a variable called `rl` that is an instance of the `readline` module. This variable represents the input stream for the CLI.\n4. Next, we define a function called `onLine` that will be called whenever the user types something into the CLI and presses enter. This function takes no arguments and returns nothing.\n5. Inside the `onLine` function, we use the `rl.question()` method to prompt the user for input. We pass in a string that is displayed to the user as a prompt, and then wait for them to respond by pressing enter.\n6. When the user presses enter, the `onLine` function is called again with the user's response as an argument. This time, we use the `process.exit()` method to exit the CLI cleanly.\n7. Finally, we define a variable called `stop` that is a function that will be called when the user presses `Ctrl + C` to stop the CLI. Inside this function, we use the `rl.close()` method to close the input stream and release any resources used by the CLI."

Here's an example of each:\n\nRecursive Approach:\n```javascript\nfunction fibonacci(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return n;\n  return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);\n}\n```\nThis function takes in an integer `n` and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The function uses the recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the previous two terms. The base case is when `n <= 1`, in which case the function simply returns the value of `n`.\n\nIterative Approach:\n```javascript\nfunction fibonacci(n) {\n  let a = 0;\n  let b = 1;\n  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {\n    const c = a + b;\n    a = b;\n    b = c;\n  }\n  return b;\n}\n```\nThis function also takes in an integer `n` and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The function uses an iterative approach, where we keep track of two variables `a` and `b`, which represent the previous two terms in the sequence. We then update these variables based on the recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence, and return the value of `b` at the end.\n\nBoth functions can be used to generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number. For example:\n```javascript\nconsole.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55\n```\nThis will output the 10-th Fibonacci number, which is 55."
